# Module 9A - Build Your First React Component

## Description
This is a React app created using Vite that renders a UserProfile component. The component includes a name, bio, and image styled with inline CSS.

## What I Learned
- How to set up a React project using Vite
- How to write and structure a functional React component
- How to use JSX and inline styles
- How to render a component in App.jsx

## Challenges
Briefly describe any errors, bugs, or confusion you encountered and how you solved it.

Name part was missing color which causes it to be white and not visible. Added color code to fix it

## Screenshot
Add a screenshot of your rendered component (you can drag and drop it here if using GitHub web interface).
